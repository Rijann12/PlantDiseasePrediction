     ## üëã Welcome to **DeepLeaf** ‚Äì Your AI-Powered Plant Health Companion!

    Say goodbye to guesswork and hello to smart farming.  
    **DeepLeaf** uses deep learning to detect plant diseases from images ‚Äî fast, simple, and accessible to everyone.

    ### üîç What is DeepLeaf?
    DeepLeaf is an intelligent plant disease detection platform that helps users identify crop issues by simply uploading a leaf image. Whether you're growing vegetables at home or managing a farm,
     DeepLeaf gives you quick insights and actionable suggestions to protect your plants.
    ### üöÄ What Does This System Do?
                
    This platform allows you to:
    -  Upload images of affected plant leaves
    -  Detect potential plant diseases using a trained CNN model
    -  Get instant prevention and treatment suggestions powered by AI

    ### üîç How It Works:
    1. **Capture or Select a Leaf Image** ‚Äî Preferably with visible symptoms.
    2. **Upload the Image** in the **Disease Recognition** section.
    3. **Receive Diagnosis** ‚Äî The model predicts the disease, and you'll get tailored advice.

    ### üåü Key Features:
    -  **Accurate Predictions** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    -  **Real-time Analysis** for faster decision-making
    -  **Integrated AI Suggestions** for remedies and preventive actions
    -  **Simple, Clean Interface** with no login or complex setup required

                #### About Dataset
                This dataset is recreated using offline augmentation from the original dataset.The original dataset can be found on this github repo.
                This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes.The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure.
                A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
